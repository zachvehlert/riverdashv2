# About RiverDash

This site is a simple tool for tracking flows on your favorite rivers. **RiverDash will always be free and will never require a login.**

## Getting Started

Use the **Add River** button to add gauges to your dashboard.

## Reading the Data

Click on any river to edit its display name, flow thresholds, and measurement type.

Flow values are shown in either feet (ft) or cubic feet per second (cfs).

## Color Coding

### Level

| Example | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `1,234 cfs` (green) | Water level is within set range |
| `1,234 cfs` (red) | Water level is outside set range |
| `1,234 cfs` (gray) | Water level range is not set |

### Trend

| Example | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| ⬆️ 12.3 cfs/hr | Water level is rising |
| ⬇️ 8.5 cfs/hr | Water level is falling |
| Flat | Water level is stable |

## Custom Gauges

Switch to the **Custom Gauge** tab when adding a river to create a derived gauge that performs math on real USGS readings. Pick a base gauge, then add one or more operations (+, −, ×, ÷) using either a flat number or another USGS gauge.

## Data Storage

Your gauge list is saved in your browser's local storage. No account or login is needed — just bookmark the page and your dashboard will be waiting for you.
